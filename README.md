# Fixed-gear Bicycles
A fixed-gear bicycle, also known as a fixie or fixed-wheel is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism. The freewheel was first developed in the early history of bicycle design. A 'fixie' is the oldest and simplist type of bicylce.   

Because of its simplicity the fixed-gear bicycle has become a popular amougst urban cyclists.

## Purpose
This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

I am anxious to learn more about using Git and GitHub in class. I am also excited to learn more about fixed-gear bicycles.
