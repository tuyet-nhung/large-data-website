**These days** you can't go into any major metropolitan area without seeing some young, tattooed kid on a fixed-gear bike. The single-geared beasts of burden are often built for speed and gained notoriety among messenger culture, before being appropriated by tree-hugging, smog-hating hipsters everywhere... but you know, in an ironic way.

Even if you don't live in Portland, Oregon or Williamsburg, Brooklyn, these rides are simple to maintain, easy to get used to, and also good for serious riders looking to train in the off-season. Whether you're looking to add to your collection or hoping to hop on the bandwagon for less, we got you covered.
