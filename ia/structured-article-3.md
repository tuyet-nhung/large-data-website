Go into any gym where experienced weightlifters gather, and ask any one of them to define [intensity](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.php?page=Intensity) More than likely they will respond with answers along the lines of, "pushing as much weight as you can handle", leaving out any mention of proper form. Gyms are filled with inexperienced members. Unfortunately, these members are usually the loud ones who are more than willing to share their misinformation with anyone in shouting distance. Granted, increasing poundage in lifts is one aspect of intensity, but there is much more to it.

The next time you go to the gym, challenge these gurus to complete the [quad training](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.php?page=Quadriceps) regimen below. I know for a fact that it works because I have tried it myself. I have passed it along to many that would dare attempt it, and they are now believers. You see, an increase in intensity can be achieved by decreasing the weight, and increasing the reps. This is an increase not to the 15-20 range, but rather, the 35-50 range!
